# Contributing to mpool

We are currently focused on collaborating with the Linux community
to get mpool upstream, and not able to accept contributions at this time.
However, see the [mpool Wiki](https://github.com/hse-project/mpool/wiki)
for how you can report a bug,
make a feature request, provide feedback, or ask a question.

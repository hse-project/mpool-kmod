 *	if the PD could be added in a media class.
 * @devrpt:
 *
 * If the media class doesn't exist yet, it is created here.
 *
 * This function has two inputs related to the PD it is acting on:
 *  "phd"
 *  and "omf_devparm"
 *
 * If omf_devparm is NULL, it means that the media class in which the PD must
 * be placed is derived from mp->pds_pdv[pdh].pdi_parm.dpr_prop
 * In that case the PD properties (.dpr_prop) must be updated and
 * correct when entering this function.
 * devparm is NULL when the device is available, that means the discovery
 * was able to update .dpr_prop.
 *
 * If omf_devparm is not NULL, it means that the media class in which the PD
 * must be placed is derived from omf_devparm.
 * This is used when unavailable PDs are placed in their media class. In this
 * situation (because the PD is unavailable) the discovery couldn't discover
 * the PD properties and mp->pds_pdv[pdh].pdi_parm.dpr_prop has not been
 * updated because of that.
 * So we can't use .dpr_prop to place the PD in its class, instead we use what
 * is coming from the persitent metadata (PD state record in MDC0). Aka
 * omf_devparm.
 * mp->pds_pdv[pdh].pdi_parm.dpr_prop will be update if/when the PD is available
 * again.
 *
 * Restrictions in placing PDs in media classes
 * --------------------------------------------
 * This function enforces these restrictions.
 * These restrictions are:
 * a) in a mpool, for a given mclassp (enum mp_media_classp), there is
 *    at maximum one media class.
 * b) All drives of a media class must checksummed or none, no mix allowed.
 * c) The STAGING and CAPACITY classes must be both checksummed or both not
 *    checksummed.
 * c) the PDs in a same media class must have the same "model". The "model"
 *    of a PD is obtained from the "model" file in sysfs.
 *    This restriction is ignored if the force option (-f) is used with the
 *    command "mpool create" or "mpool add".
 * d) the PDs of a same media class must have same:
 *    - enum mp_media_classp
 *    - zonepg (zone size)
 *    - logical sector size as defined by pd_prop.pdp_sectorsz
 *    - type (enum pd_devtype)
 *    - features (enum mp_mc_features)
 *
 * What is the impact of the force option on the PDs classification?
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * The force option has an impact only if used for the mpool create or mpool add
 * commands (mpool creation or adding a PD in an mpool).
 * In that case, if -f is used, it relaxes only the one constraint that is:
 *   PDs of a same media class must have a same model.
 *
 * When the restrictions on PDs classification are applied?
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * When a mpool is created and when a PD is added to mpool.
 * This function is also called when an mpool is activated or destroyed.
 * At that point the check of the restrictions that can be bypassed (with -f)
 * is not done.
 * Because mpool doesn't remember what restriction was bypassed with the -f
 * option at mpool creation or mpool PD addition time.
 *
 * Locking:
 * -------
 *	Should be called with mp.pds_pdvlock held in write.
 *	Except if mpool is single threaded (during activate for example).

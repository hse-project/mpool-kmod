 *   There is one entry in the table with its mi_mdcver being 1.0.0.0.
 * - binary 1.0.0.1 is released and changes mpool MDC content semantic (for
 *   example chenge the meaning of media class enum). This release adds the
 *   entry 1.0.0.1 in this table.
 * - binary 1.0.1.0 is released and doesn't change MDCs content semantic/format,
 *   MDCs content generated by 1.0.1.0 binary is still compatible with a
 *   1.0.0.1 binary reading it.
 *   No entry is added in the table.
 * - binary 2.0.0.0 is released and it changes MDCs content semantic.
 *   A third entry is added in the table with its mi_mdcver being 2.0.0.0.
